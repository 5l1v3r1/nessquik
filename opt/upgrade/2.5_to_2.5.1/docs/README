This is a bugfix release that addresses several problems that were reported.

- Individual plugins not being set in the nessusrc files that were generated
- Special plugin profiles not be evaluated correctly at nessusrc generation time
- Scan results not being saved to the database

My most sincere thanks to Andy Michaelson and Joe Klemencic for debugging these
problems and reporting them with solid info.

Thanks also to everyone who stopped by my inbox for help!

== Upgrade Instructions ==

Easy. Use the mysql command to modify the database using the SQL supplied in the
sql/ directory. Note that 'database' is the name of the nessquik database. Please
change this to suite your particular installation

	mysql -u user -p database < sql/upgrade.sql

You will be prompted for your mysql password.

The upgrade will be complete after that.
